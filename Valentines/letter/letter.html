Happy Valentine's Day,

My Fiancee

Myriam my love, my date, my everything. I wish I could be there with you.
it pains my heart that all I can do is this letter. I hope and pray it
atleast shows I love you and miss you and that even in the situation
we're in, I will still do what I can do to make you happy.

Anyway back to how much I love you, how beautiful you are! You're amazing,
stunning, kind, hot, and you are like the moon to the earth, you perpetually
orbit  my mind and heart.

Sorry to change the topic but, I'm listening to spotify and "Just the way you are"
by Bruno Mars came on, and honestly it reminds me of you, the line where he says:
"And when you smile.. the whole world stops and stares for a while..". Infact
the whole song fits for us, from me to you. A new song from me to you.

I know my writing skills suck, but I blame my lack of desk, and tidy room.
This letter has been copied from paper form, I still have the original to give to you.
My baby girl, if I could take out my heart, I would give it to you, because it's yours,
I am yours, forever and ever. I have said a lot of different things in letters in the past,
you may think I am repeating myself, but the feelings I had when I wrote the letters before to
the letter I am writing now is like an atom in comparrison to a universe.
My love never stops growing for you! Like the never ending distant of space, how it expands infinitely.
I hope you have enjoyed reading this letter and to remember how much you mean to me.

Happy Valentine’s Day, Soulheart.
I love you more than anything.

— Harry 💘
